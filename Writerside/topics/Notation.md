# Notation

> When writing the notes for everything, I use a lot of notation, which is going to be defined here.
I recommend you read this page before continuing on to any other math pages, as it should aid in understanding.
As my writings grow longer, this page will increase in size.

Sometimes, math is difficult to read as-is.
The $f(x)$ notation in replacement for $y$ is well known, but then there's the darker end that nobody looks at except for the truly dedicated.
I sometimes use that notation, because it's a concise way to represent a rule / transformation, which is when any symbol I use will be put into this master list.
Also, there's an example for each.

$\|$
: This represents the word "or".
I most often use this when referring to inequality / interval notation, since some are taught one or the other.
: While it isn't official, this is specifically brought from my programming experience.
: Example: $0 \leq x \leq 5 \; \| \; (0,5)$
<!-- Contribution Note: In LaTex, I usually use "$\; \| \;$" for it.
This is to allow proper spacing between the inequality, or symbol, and interval. -->

$\&\&$
: This represents the word "and".
Usually used when referring to multiple solutions.
: Again, brought from my C# knowledge.
: Example: $x = 5 \; \&\& \; x = 3$
<!-- Contribution Note: In LaTex, I'll use "$\; \&\& \;$" for representing and.
Again, adequate spacing.-->

$\to$
: This represents a step in an equation, or a result from something.
Often for simplification as well.

$\to_c$
: This is a branch of the arrow, which specifically is for identity conversions.

$\mathbb{N, Z, Q, R, C}$
: These are the sets of numbers.
In order:
: Natural numbers (1, 2, 3 $\dots \infty$)
: Integers ($-\infty \dots$ -1, 0, 1 $\dots \infty$)
: Rational Numbers ($-\infty \dots \infty$) excluding anything like non-perfect roots, and most constants
: Real Numbers ($-\infty \dots \infty$)
: Complex Numbers (literally everything)
: Each entry is contained by the one below it.

$\because$, $\therefore$
: Represents "because" and "therefore" respectively.

$\in$, $\ni$
: Represents "an element of the set of".
Very common in set notation, shows when a variable needs to be / is a part of a set of numbers.
: Example: $x \in A \; \| \; A \ni x$.
$\ni$ is the reverse of $\in$.
The set is on the three-pronged side, always.

$s.t.$
: Represents "such that".
It's used when criteria is required for an equation, an example in words is
"x is equal to x^3 **such that** x is equal to 1 or 0.", because otherwise it isn't true.
: Note: I originally was going to use $\ni$, but after some research, $s.t.$ is much more common.
