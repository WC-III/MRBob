## 1.4 Overview {switcher-key="1.4"}
Polynomials are the first major category of functions in AP Precalculus.
They form the backbone of nearly all other functions, and are the foundation to factoring, rational functions, trigonometric inequalities and identities.

### Polynomial Terms

Polynomial Function
: The first true mathematical definition of this course.
: A polynomial function is defined as any function equation of the general form:
: $\begin{align*} f(x) &= a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} \\ &+ a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \dots + a_2x^2 \\ &+ a_1x + a_0 \end{align*}$
: where n is a positive integer ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$), n is positive ($n \geq 0$),
a with a subscript of i is a real number ($a_i \in \mathbb{R}$) with a subscript from n to 0, and a with a subscript of n is not zero ($a_n \neq 0$)

All below will use that general form.

Leading Term
: The term with the largest exponent.
: $a_nx^n$

Leading Coefficient
: The coefficient of the variable with the largest exponent.
: $a_n$

Degree
: The largest exponent.
: $n$

### Classifying Polynomials
You classify the polynomial by two qualifiers - the term, and the degree.

An equation of $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a quadratic trinomial, because a degree of two and 3 terms.
You won't necessarily need all of these, but it's useful when conveying what the function is without reading it outright.
For example, saying "since this is a **binomial**, we need to do **x**" is applicable.
Or, "since this is a **degree of 5**, then it is unsolvable by a direct formula" works too.

#### Unsolvable? {collapsible=true}
So, you might be wondering why I used that second one as an example.
A polynomial of degree 5 or higher does not have a true formula to just solve it, relying on factoring more than anything.
This was proven by both Paolo Ruffini and Niels Henrik Abel, in 1813. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem).
